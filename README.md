2. Simply <ins>click the 'Start Game' Button</ins> and the app will select **3 random images** from a database which is sorted based on the difficulty level and present them to you.  
3. Use the Stylus of your choice to **replicate the image** presented to you as close as possible
4. When you are ready, <ins>click the 'Judge' button</ins>, which **compares your drawing** with the original image given to you.  
5. The game will then give you **a grade and score**, and you can move on to the next image.
